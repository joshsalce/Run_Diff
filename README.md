# Chart the Run Differential 1.0

In my entry into the world of sabermetrics and R, I realized that there is no way to see run differential charted over a single season. So I thought it would be fun to make a cool little application that can calculate the run differential of a team over a year, with a chart showing the overall trend. 

This application was created in less than a couple of hours in August, but is only being uploaded as I expanded the application on and off for  the next month and a half. The second part to this is also uploaded to my Github, but I'll leave the details for that over in that repo.
